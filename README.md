# ShellScript1
Shell Script Final Project 1

Author: Emily VanDerveer

This script is written in the Bash command language.

This script locates executeable files. It takes a list of file names
from the command line and determines which would be executed had these
names be given as commands.

usage: mywhich [-a] command ...

 -a is a flag that will check for all occurances of the command
 by default it will only find the first occurance
